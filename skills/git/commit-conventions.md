# Skill: Commit Conventions

## Format
```
type(scope): concise description

[optional body — explain WHY, not WHAT]

[optional footer — references, breaking changes]
```

## Types
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `chore`: Build, CI, tooling changes
- `style`: Formatting, no code change

## Rules
- Subject line: imperative mood, lowercase, no period, max 72 chars
- Body: wrap at 72 chars, explain motivation and context
- Reference the plan/phase when applicable: `Part of plan: [feature-name] Phase 2`
- One logical change per commit — don't mix refactoring with features

## PR Description
```markdown

## Multi-Repo Projects

When the project uses separate git repos per stack (e.g., `server/` and `web/` are each their own repo):

- **Check which repo you're in** before committing: `git -C <dir> rev-parse --show-toplevel`
- **Commit from within the stack directory**: `git -C server add . && git -C server commit -m "..."`
- **Never combine changes across repos** in a single commit — they are independent histories
- **If a phase touched multiple repos** (it shouldn't), make separate commits in each
