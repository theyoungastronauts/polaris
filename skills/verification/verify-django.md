# Skill: Verify Django

## Purpose
Systematic verification checklist for Django/DRF code. Used by the reviewer agent in a separate Claude session after code execution.

## Verification Process

Run through each section. Flag issues as PASS, WARN, or FAIL.

### 1. Tests
- [ ] Tests exist for new/changed code
- [ ] `pytest` passes with no failures
- [ ] Test coverage is reasonable (not just happy path)
- [ ] Factory data is realistic (not "test123" placeholder values)

### 2. Models
- [ ] Migrations are generated and match model changes
- [ ] No migration conflicts with main branch
- [ ] New fields have sensible defaults or are nullable where appropriate
- [ ] Indexes exist on fields used in filters/lookups
- [ ] `__str__` methods are defined

### 3. Serializers
- [ ] Fields are explicitly listed (no `__all__`)
- [ ] Read vs write serializers separated where needed
- [ ] Validation covers edge cases (empty strings, nulls, boundaries)
- [ ] Nested serializer performance — no N+1 from nested reads

### 4. Views
- [ ] `permission_classes` set on every view
- [ ] Querysets use `select_related`/`prefetch_related` appropriately
- [ ] Pagination is configured for list endpoints
- [ ] Error responses are consistent and informative
- [ ] No business logic in views — delegated to models/services

### 5. Security
- [ ] Authentication required on all non-public endpoints
- [ ] Object-level permissions checked (not just role-based)
- [ ] No sensitive data in response bodies that shouldn't be there
- [ ] Input validation prevents injection (Django handles most, but check raw SQL)

### 6. API Contract
- [ ] Endpoint paths follow project conventions
- [ ] Response shapes are consistent with existing endpoints
- [ ] Integration summary is up to date
- [ ] Breaking changes are documented

### 7. Code Quality
- [ ] No commented-out code
- [ ] No debug prints or leftover logging
- [ ] Imports are clean (no unused)
- [ ] Linting passes (ruff/flake8)
- [ ] Type hints on function signatures
